The Currency Converter is a web-based application that allows users to convert one currency to another using real-time exchange rates. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a clean and interactive user interface with dynamic flag updates for selected countries.

The app fetches live exchange rate data from ExchangeRate.host, ensuring accurate and up-to-date conversions. Users can enter any amount, select their desired "From" and "To" currencies, and get instant results. It is mobile-responsive and perfect for quick currency checks on the go.
